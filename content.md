## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Hey there, I'm Samuel!  
I'm a 16 y.o freelancer in the IT field, a libertarian/crypto-anarchist, and I'm currently working on a project called LibertyLoft. I also serve as a Local Coordinator for Students for Liberty.

## ðŸ’¡ My Beliefs

I'm deeply passionate about technology, individual freedom, and the potential of decentralized systems. My work spans IT development, community organizing, and exploring the intersection of technology and liberty.

When I'm not coding or organizing events, you'll find me behind a camera, capturing the world through my libertarian lens, or diving deep into cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies.

## ðŸš€ Projects

### 1. [LibertyLoft](https://LibertyLoft.cz)

LibertyLoft is a new community center in Prague dedicated to bringing together the libertarian, anarcho-capitalist, and freedom-oriented community.  
Our mission is to create a vibrant space for organizing events, discussions, and sharing knowledge and friendship.  
Itâ€™s open to anyone interested in freedom, collaboration, and new ideas.

### 2. Thinkhome

Thinkhome was my company with a few of my partners. Our goal was to make technology accessible for everyone.  
We also offered hosting, website creation, consulting, and personalized IT management services.  
Unfortunately, the project is on hold right now, but Iâ€™m still doing the same things, just on a smaller scale, under my own name.  
**Feel free to reach out if you need anything!**

### 3. Students for Liberty

Students for Liberty is a student organization thatâ€™s all about spreading ideas through events and activities.  
Theyâ€™re like a group of freedom fighters who connect people who share their values.

Theyâ€™re pretty close to classical liberalism, libertarianism, and anarcho-capitalism, so their main goals are social, economic, and academic freedom, and respecting private property.  
I joined SFL at the end of 2023, and since the start of 2025, Iâ€™ve been a local coordinator.

### 4. Photography

One of my hobbies is photography, even though Iâ€™m not exactly a pro.
