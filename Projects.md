# ðŸ’» ThinkHome

ThinkHome was a company I launched with a few friends, aiming to make technology accessible to everyone. We provided hosting, web development, consulting, and personalized IT management. Right now, ThinkHome is on hold, but I'm still here, offering similar services individually. Need help with tech? Just [reach out](/contact)!

# ðŸ“š Students for Liberty

Students for Liberty (SFL) is an international student organization dedicated to promoting freedom through engaging events and activities. I joined SFL in late 2023 and have been serving as a Local Coordinator since early 2025.

One of my favorite hobbies is photography. I'm not a professional, but I love capturing moments and sharing my perspective through photos. Curious to see my work? Check out my gallery!
