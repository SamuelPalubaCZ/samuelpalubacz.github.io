## About Me

Hey there, I'm Samuel! I'm a 16-year-old freelancer in the IT field, a libertarian/crypto-anarchist, and I'm currently working on a project called **LibertyLoft**. I also serve as a **Local Coordinator for Students for Liberty**.

My beliefs center around individual freedom, economic liberty, and decentralized governance.

## Projects

### 🏢 LibertyLoft

**LibertyLoft** is a new community center in Prague dedicated to bringing together the libertarian, anarcho-capitalist, and freedom-oriented community. Our mission is to create a vibrant space for organizing events, discussions, and sharing knowledge and friendship. It's open to anyone interested in freedom, collaboration, and new ideas.

?> **Website:** [LibertyLoft.cz](https://LibertyLoft.cz)

### 💻 Thinkhome *(On Hold)*

**Thinkhome** was my company with a few of my partners. Our goal was to make technology accessible for everyone to use. We also offered:

- Hosting services
- Website creation
- IT consulting
- Personalized IT management

!> Unfortunately, the project is on hold right now, but I'm still doing the same things, just on a smaller scale, under my own name. Feel free to reach out if you need anything!

### 🎓 Students for Liberty

**Students for Liberty** is a student organization that's all about spreading their ideas through events and activities. They're like a group of freedom fighters who connect people who share their values.

They're aligned with:
- Classical liberalism
- Libertarianism  
- Anarcho-capitalism

Their main goals focus on **social, economic, and academic freedom**, and respecting private property. I joined SFL at the end of 2023, and since the start of 2025, I've been a local coordinator.

### 📸 Photography

One of my hobbies is photography, even though I'm not exactly a pro. You can check out my photos here!
